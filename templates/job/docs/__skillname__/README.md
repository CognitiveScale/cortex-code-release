# Job Skill Example

This workspace template demonstrates a simple job skill skeleton that simply prints out the job payload when invoked.

## Building and Publishing the Skill

In order to build the job skill Docker image, simply select "Build Skills" from the Cortex menu in the IDE.  You can also right-click on the `skill.yaml` file for the skill and select "Build Skill" from the Cortex context menu.

Once the skill is built, you can publish it the same way, by selecting "Publish".
